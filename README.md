DRAIV (pronounced “drive”) is an intelligent driver-assistance system that sees, reasons, and speaks in real time. It detects traffic signs, tracks moving vehicles and pedestrians, monitors lane position, and delivers concise voice alerts.
DRAIV is tuned for elderly drivers, novices, and people with disabilities and ships in GPU-enabled Docker containers so every collaborator or reviewer runs the identical stack—from a laptop to an AWS GPU instance to a Jetson edge device.
